List of Models for Jak 2 on OpenGOAL

Installation steps:

1- Open local files (you can access them from the launcher in the advanced settings tab)

2- Create a folder "merc_replacements" at this destination: Documents\active\jak2\data\custom_assets\jak2

2- Now you can drag and drop the downloaded .glb files into the "merc_replacements" folder (the name of Jak's model is "jakb-lod0" for example)

3- Now you need to decompile the game, from the launcher in the advanced settings.

4-You can now launch Jak 2 to enjoy lots of custom models!

PS : This manipulation also works for Jak 1 and 3, but some visual bugs may appear.

You can also modify the model yourself to improve it, using Blender. (The file must always be in .glb format.)
